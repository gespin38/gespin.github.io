		<h1>"what if i said that i didn't know"...before the pandemic</h1>
		<h2>book | 5.5” × 8.5” | 188 pages | 2020</h2>
		<p>little did i know that while i was scanning old photos and building my thesis project, a case of something unfamiliar would start spreading like wildfire—something known as covid-19. our senior thesis exhibition was slated to open in late march 2020. and when covid-19 started to create its ripple effect, our exhibition was turned into an <a href="https://www.rutgersbfa2020.net/dejareve/"target="_blank">online gallery</a>—transforming my nearly-finished book into a microsite in a matter of days. </p>

		<p><br>"what if i said that i didn't know" was a book because when i was investigating more about the history of my family and their journeys, i knew a book would allow me to use large amounts of text and it would allow the reader to be taken on a journey that only they can control the pace of. inspired by some of the things i'd write in my journal about the challenges of being first generation, i started to layout text and images.</p>

		<p><br>from the moment you open the book, you are immersed into a world of color. by using typography and transparency, the left side of the book was used to tell my story while the right side was used to tell my parents' story.<br><br>as you continue the book you notice a color gets added for every memory that is mentioned—ultimately creating the colorful stripes that symbolizes identity and history.</p>
