			<p>something always present in my life was a colorful pattern. one with many stripes. and stripe after stripe and layer after layer they always created a beautiful bright pattern. something as bright and colorful as every one of my visits to peru. 
			<br><br>
			the striped pattern that symbolizes so much for peru, meant something else for me. it was a symbol of question for me. something that led me to question how in touch i was with peruvian culture and something that always made me question my identity. and as a first generation peruvian-american, i questioned the balance of both cultures throughout my life because i was expected to know more about my culture. for me, it became a symbol that triggered me to look not only at my past but the past from the people who did everything they could to get me where i am now—my parents. 
			<br><br>
			this led me to do two things—take a look back at everything in my life thus far and investigate how my parents’ life played a part in this. what i noticed was the similar patterns seen in both my parents life and mine. i saw these experiences and struggles as layered colors that makes up who i am. as each layer gets added, it ultimately creates something entirely chaotic, beautiful and whole, all establishing a familiar sense of identity.
